# Contentful Workshop: Your Year in Music
A music themed workshop project for Render ATL.

We really love music at Contentful — so much that we even have our own company band. In this workshop, we’ll marry our passion for content and tunes to give you an introduction to headless content management and show you that a CMS can be used to bring infinite ideas to life beyond just your typical blogs.

When you think about content management systems, the first one that probably pops into your head is one of the traditional OGs: Wordpress. But did you know there are some more flexible options when it comes to content for the web? In came “headless” where you have the flexibility to organize your content and choose your preferred programing language or framework when building.

In this hands-on workshop we’re going to dive into Contentful, build something awesome and walk through the following:
* Learn about flexible content
* Integrate third-party APIs with custom apps
* Use tools like GraphQL and Next.js for the frontend
* Demonstrate how you can use a CMS beyond just blogs

This workshop is being taught by Developer Advocate Brittany Walker (aka Musical Web Dev) so we will be creating a fun music-themed project together.
